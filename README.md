# DogsAPI

### My First Golang REST API (ðŸš§WIPðŸš§)

The idea is to build an API for a service that handles dog accommodation/lodging reservations, as that is my family current area of work.

#### Goal (for now)
The final goal is to have an API with:

- User Authentication
- User Authorization
- Account creation confirmation (via email token)
- Dogs/Users relationship established across useful routes
- Reservation/payment simulation

When the API is ready, I'll deploy it and start working on the frontend.

### Stack and Tools (for now)
- [ ] go
- [ ] stdlib net/http package for routing, handling and serving
- [ ] PostgreSQL 
- [ ] [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for DB migrations
